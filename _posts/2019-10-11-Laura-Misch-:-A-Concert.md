**Laura Misch** is not famous (*yet*) but promising young artist from London. Her style is electronic, ambient, a little jazzy and has saxophone in it.

The venue was called *Pop-Up du Label*. It's a bar + concert venue. It was cozy inside, very small and nice.

Her opening act was *Silk-J*. I hadn't heard of her. Her music is a little bit too ordinary, I couldn't find distinguishing features in it. However, she seemed happy to be on the stage and people got her **positive vibes**. She finished with coming down and sang among the audience, that was a brilliant idea but a little bit too early for her, because **it gets intimidating unless you establish an extraordinary connection with the audience**, which wasn't the case unfortunately.

I was already listening to Laura Misch for a while before the concert. I was expecting someone quite serious and distant/cold but she turned out to be **extremely likeable and lovely**. She was obviously enjoying being on the stage and her own music. She also told the stories behind her songs:

**Glass shards:** she wants to climb the skyscrapers in London at night. As she can't (since they are "private properties"), she fulfills her dream in her own reality, in her own song. 

**Blue dot:** We, modern people, follow the blue dot in our navigation app in our smartphone. We don't know what it is but we follow the blue dot. If you don't listen to the lyrics, you can't guess that one is about tech&society because the song has a mellow, ballad-like tone although it is kind of a satire.

There are people who see *differently*. We all look at the clouds but only they see the beard of Santa Clause. Laura is one of them. She is lucky, she is so talented that she can express what she sees/thinks/feels in an interesting way: music. Otherwise, nobody would probably listen to her talking about climbing to the Shard at night. It's usually said that the music is a way of expressing ourselves. I heard that a zillion times before but I've just come to understand it really.

It was very cool to see a "*different*" one playing nice music on a small stage. I can imagine her being the headliner of a festival or something in the future.

On the downside, the audience was horrible! A few people right behind me talked too loudly many times. Especially, there was an American guy who never stopped talking. I really don't understand why they come to a concert if they wanna talk?
I don't know if she was just being polite but Laura said "I mean, feel free to talk…"

*Observation: %99 of the jokes made while watching the concerts are NOT funny. Your friend smiles at your jokes because they don't hear you and they don't wanna ask "sorry, what did you say?" so they laugh to shut you up. Please stop talking at the concerts and  making stupid jokes!*
